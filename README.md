# Pig Dice

A simple dice game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

## Rules
1. On each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they wish, and each dice value gets added to their current score.
2. **IF** a player rolls a 1 however, the current score value becomes 0 and it's the next players turn.
3. A player can choose to hold their current score, which then gets added to their total score and then it becomes the next players turn.
4. First player to 100 points wins the game.

2. Clone the fork to your local machine.
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/${your_username}/pig-dice

3. Install the npm dependencies from your local copy path*
    - I used `live-server` for serving the application, and it is the only npm dependency. If you already have that installed globally, you can skip this step.
```javascript
npm install
```
4. Run the application
```javascript
> live-server
```
